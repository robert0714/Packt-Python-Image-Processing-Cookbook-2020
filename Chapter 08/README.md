## Object detection with HOG/SVM
### Key words
* **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**: HOG descriptors can be computed from an image by first computing the horizontal and vertical gradient images, then computing the gradient histograms and normalizing across blocks, and finally flattening into a feature descriptor vector. 
* Â **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** :a (linear) SVM  binary classifier model is trained with several positive and negative training example images.

## Object detection with Yolo V3
* https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
```bash
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
```
### There's more...
The pretrained weights were obtained by training the model with the MS-COCO image dataset (get it from here: http://cocodataset.org/) as input. Try to train the model on your own and then use the model to detect objects in some unseen images.
